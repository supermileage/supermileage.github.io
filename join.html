              <p>
                Vehicle Mechanics in charge of the aerodynamics, structure, handling, and safety of our vehicles.
                Consequently, the division works with many different components and systems such as aerodynamic
                shells, chassis, steering, braking, and roll bars.
                With ample opportunity to tackle hands-on design, testing, and manufacturing
                challenges, some goals for the division this year include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Improving the aerodynamics of our Urban Concept vehicle
                </li>
                <li>
                  Investigating new chassis designs, including monocoque vehicles
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reducing mass by using composite materials for more components such as roll bars
                </li>
                <li>
                  Optimizing vehicle steering to reduce losses

              <h3 class="text-uppercase">Projects</h3>
              <h5>Urban Shell Design</h5>
              <p>
                Designing a new Urban vehicle aerodynamic shell that has very low drag and is structurally rigid
                .Incorporates vehicle aerodynamics, rapid prototyping and verification tests. Prototyping and
                verification tests include wind tunnel model testing and fluid dynamics simulations using STAR-CCM.
              </p>
              <h5>Steering Redesign</h5>
              <p>
                Comprehensive, ground up steering system redesign. Must account for wheel alignment, driver
                accomodation, and geometry constraints imposed by the shell and chassis.
              </p>
              <h5>Foot-Actuated Brakes</h5>
              <p>
                Due to a new rule for the Shell Eco-Marathon competition, a new foot-actuated brake system must be
                implemented for our Prototype vehicle. The project will focus on creating a system that complies with
                competition rules, is lightweight, and the driver can easily use.
              </p>
              <h5>Composite Roll Bar</h5>
              <p>This year we will be designing a new rollbar for our Prototype vehicle that will be made from composite
                material. If a feasible design is developed, then the rollbar will be manufactured. If not found
                feasible, the rollbar will instead be made from another type of material (eg. aluminum) with a different
                design.
              </p>
              <h5>New Honeycomb Chassis</h5>
              <p>Designing a new lightweight chassis for a Prototype vehicle using composite material such as carbon
                fiber and Nomex honeycomb. Includes physical and virtual testing such as destructive stress tests and
                ANSYS ACP.

              <p>
                Electrical is responsible for designing the electrical components of the vehicles
                and validation testing of all required electrical systems. These systems include
                telemetry, motor control, fuel cell control, and battery systems. Some divisional
                goals for this year include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Completing the development of a custom brushless DC motor controller for the Urban Concept vehicle
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improving fuel cell monitoring and control systems
                </li>
                <li>
                  Continuing to improve the team's telemetry capabilities so more data can be collected from all three vehicles

              <h5>PCB Design</h5>
              <p>
                Our internal components are mounted on custom PCBs, thus we're always looking to improve and refactor.
              </p>
              <h5>Starter Motor</h5>
              <p>
                To improve the efficiency of the car, we are always looking to reduce its weight. One of the ways we are
                looking to achieve this is to replace the current starter motor on the Prototype Vehicle with a smaller
                (lighter) one. Members completing this project will need to work closely with the Powertrain team. If
                you have experience testing, characterizing, or designing motors, this project is for you.
              </p>
              <h5>Telemetry</h5>
              <p>
                Designing a robust telemetry system in order to know the state of the car by publishing real time data
                from all the sensors within the vehicle to the cloud to be viewed from anywhere. This will allow data
                driven decisions to be made for tuning, and increace performace and reliability.
