                  UBC Supermileage was founded in 2001 by UBC engineering students Rob Mahaffey and
                  Brian Jung. The goal of the team was to develop a highly fuel-efficient car to
                  compete in the SAE Supermileage competition while providing an opportunity for
                  student engineers to apply classroom theories to real-world problems. The team
                  started out small, with 6 students doing most of the organization, fundraising,
                  design, fabrication, and assembly of the vehicle. The team’s small size compared to
                  other UBC student teams did not prevent it from being successful at the competition,
                  and in fact UBC Supermileage achieved a first-place position 4 years in a row, and the
                  team record of 3145 mpg in 2006.

                  In the 2006/2007 academic year, the team consisted mostly of new members after the
                  core members graduated from UBC. This was a difficult year for the team as the new
                  members had to rebuild the team’s sponsorship relationships, available resources,
                  and technical knowledge base due to the lack of turnover documentation from the
                  now-graduated core members. Attempting new challenges, the team would go on to
                  compete at the Shell Eco-Marathon. The team overcame these challenges to obtain a
                  respectable fourth-place position in the 2008 SEMA competition.

                  After several years of success in the SAE Supermileage competition and a brief trial
                  at SEMA, the team decided to commit to competing in the Shell Eco-Marathon in a new
                  team direction with the Urban Concept division. This class of vehicle was intended
                  to promote cars that were closer to typical road-legal vehicles, marking a
                  significant change from the Prototype vehicles that competed in the SAE Supermileage
                  competition. During this time, the team also grew significantly in size to
                  approximately 60 members, with 14-18 students making up the core leadership of the
                  team. The larger team allowed UBC Supermileage for the first time to send both an
                  Urban and a Prototype-class vehicle to competition in a single year, which took
                  place at the 2013 Shell Eco-Marathon.

                  When returning from the 2014 Shell Eco-Marathon, both the team’s vehicles were lost
                  in a shipping accident. Almost every part of the vehicles was destroyed, and much of
                  what was left was too damaged to be reused. While this setback could have caused the
                  team to miss the Shell Eco-Marathon for a year or more, the leadership of team
                  captain Katelyn Currie ensured that both vehicles were rebuilt from scratch in time
                  for the 2015 Shell Eco-Marathon. Under the leadership of Nancy Chu, UBC Supermileage
                  continued to develop as a team, and in 2016 sent the Prototype vehicle to both the
                  Shell Eco-Marathon and SAE Supermileage competitions, where the team was recognized
                  with the “best newcomer” award for its return to the latter competition.

                  After another large graduating cohort left in 2016, Jonathan Marr and Jocelyne Boone
                  would lead a team of mostly new leads through a challenging year. With ambitious
                  goals including engine displacement reduction and a monocoque design for the
                  Prototype vehicle, the team would gain valuable experience under their leadership
                  and learn many lessons on their way to both SEMA and SAE in 2017. In 2018, the team
                  made breakthrough progress under the leadership of Sahil Dhingra and achieved 6th
                  place at SEMA and 3rd place at SAE for the Prototype vehicle with a decade high
                  mileage of 1407 mpg. With the leads who joined in 2016 now veterans of the
                  competition, the team would pursue many ambitious goals including transitioning the
                  gasoline Urban Concept to the team’s first alternative energy battery electric
                  vehicle. Under the leadership of Cecilia Liu and Jordan Fong, the team would
                  redesign the prototype nearly from scratch and deliver two second place finishes at
                  the 2019 SEMA and SAE competitions with 2229 mpg, the second highest mileage in
                  team-history.
