With our larger group we have the capability to get much more done. Here&#8217;s a sample of what we&#8217;re working on for the Urban Concept Vehicle:

  * New chassis &#8211; we&#8217;re completely rebuilding our Urban Concept chassis, and we&#8217;re replacing the aircraft-grade aluminum honeycomb with a lighter, stiffer composite material
  * Windshield wiper &#8211; Chassis and Aero divisions are working closely to design a sturdy wiper with minimal drag
  * Brake actuators &#8211;  research is underway on a hydraulic braking system to deliver even braking that is proportional to the force delivered to the brake pedal
  * Drivetrain &#8211; a new drivetrain is being designed to obtain an optimal gear ratio
  * Fuel injection &#8211; updates and redesigns to this will give a significant increase to fuel efficiency, as every drop of gasoline is burned in the engine
  * Bearings &#8211; we&#8217;ve received new wheel bearings from SKF which are being installed; SKF will be featured in the next Sponsor Spotlight
  * Aero shell &#8211; We have several new interesting designs for the Urban Concept body shape, and we&#8217;re working with Vorum to develop some foam models for wind tunnel testing

These are some of the significant projects underway, but is by no means a comprehensive list. Thanks to everyone on the team for their hard work and dedication!
