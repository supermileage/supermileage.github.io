We hope you enjoyed the nail biting SuperBlog II coverage of our week at the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas. After a successful competition with the Odysseus coming in 3rd place at 325mpg in the Urban Concept category, we received some disappointing news. On return from Houston, Texas, the shipping truck with our crate was involved in a rollover accident, destroying both vehicles and many of our tools. No students were hurt but our thoughts are with the drivers who may have been injured in this accident. The team will be working extra hard this year to rebuild and remain highly competitive. Huge thanks to the UBC Mechanical Engineering Department, Shell and UBC faculty members for their support in these difficult times!
