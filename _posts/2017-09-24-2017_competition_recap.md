title: 2017 Competition Recap
---

As per tradition, over this summer the UBC Supermileage Team went down to Detroit
and Marshall for Shell Eco-Marathon Americas and SAE Supermileage 2017 Competitions.
We had our ups and downs, but above all we learned and had a blast!

Now with a new season underway everyone is busy at work preparing both cars for
the next competition.

In the meantime, checkout our videos summarizing our trips to competition this
year, and follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ubcst) for more updates
