We were lucky this weekend to get some expert advice from Casey Keulen on our carbon fibre lay-up for our new aero shell. Casey works for the Composites Research Network at UBC, where our very own engine co-lead Kevan Cote worked on a co-op term this summer. After Casey had told us the ins and outs of the lay-up process (air bubbles = bad) he took us on a quick tour of the CRN. Many thanks to Casey for donating some of his expert knowledge to the UBC Supermileage cause!
