If you have done any sort of CAD work in the past, chances are you&#8217;ve heard of SolidWorks. Used in industries from Aerospace to oil and gas to high tech electronics and everything in between, SolidWorks is a comprehensive yet easy to pick up 3D CAD software tool that allows users to design, publish, and maintain projects large and small.

Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corp. has given the UBC Supermileage Team a number of student copies of their powerful program, giving us the capability to build our vehicles completely in 3D model space and run tests and diagnostics before fabrication even begins. Learn more about SolidWorks products and solutions at <http://www.solidworks.com/>
