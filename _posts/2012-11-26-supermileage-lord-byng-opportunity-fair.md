Last week Lord Byng High School in Vancouver hosted its annual Opportunity Fair, an event in which high school students get to learn more about what engineering can do for them. There were many different engineering related organizations present, and representing the UBC Supermileage Team, and UBC in general, was our own Kevan Cote. Kevan spoke about Supermileage, what we stand for and what we do, and also to the opportunity to tell students about the benefits of becoming an engineer at UBC.
