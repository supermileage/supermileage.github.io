The Shell Eco-marathon America&#8217;s is over, and the results are in. This year the UBC Supermileage team achieved a fuel efficiency of 288mpg, a 74mpg improvement over our last competition and enough to place us in 3rd place for gasoline Urban Concepts and 4th place out of all Urban Concepts (this includes hydrogen, solar and electric vehicles). We are very happy with this result, but this success only makes us hungry for more. There is some room for improvement, and next year we will aim even higher in our pursuit of efficiency.

Thank you again to our many generous sponsors who&#8217;s  support has been instrumental in our success, and without whom we would not even have a vehicle for competition.
