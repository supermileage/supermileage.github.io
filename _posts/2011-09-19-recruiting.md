The UBC Supermileage Team is excited to announce two new software sponsors this year! The team is looking forward to using Dassault Systemes SolidWorks to design vehicle modifications, and to improving our body design using the Star-CCM+ software graciously provided by CD-adapco. Both programs will help us in our quest to make the Argo even more efficient as we shoot for gold at the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas this year. Thanks so much for your support!
