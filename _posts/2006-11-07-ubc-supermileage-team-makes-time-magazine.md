That&#8217;s right! Our 2006 entry to the annual SAE Supermileage competition in Michigan has made it into the TIME Best Inventions 2006. From TIME:

*Here&#8217;s a secret: you don&#8217;t really need funky alternative fuels or an electric motor to trim your energy consumption on the road. Sometimes all it takes is a little ingenuity. A team of Canadian engineering students won the annual Supermileage race in Michigan with its 80-lb. carbon-fiber Mark V, which can travel 3,145 miles on a single gallon of gas. That&#8217;s thanks to details like a curved underbody, an ultra-fuel-efficient 54-cc engine and a driver who understands why the turtle beat the hare. The catch? You have to drive lying down, and the windows don&#8217;t open.*
