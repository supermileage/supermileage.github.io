On Monday the UBC Supermileage Team had the opportunity to take part in the Canadian Innovation Summit hosted by Shell. The Summit was the first to be held in Canada and was a chance for Canadian business and technology leaders to meet with global thought leaders, policy makers, and experts from various sectors of industry and the community to discuss issues such as future energy demands and literacy. We were there exhibiting our team and our experiences building super-fuel-efficient vehicles, and throughout the day several excellent seminars and talks were given by influential Canadians including retired astronaut Chris Hadfield and Â Ellis Ross, the Chief Councilor of the Haisla Nation. It was an amazing experience to meet and speak to so many innovative individuals!
