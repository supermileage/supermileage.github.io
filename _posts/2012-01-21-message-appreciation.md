We are now very close to completing our urban concept vehicle for competition, and as such we would like to take this opportunity to recognize several organizations, whose sponsorship have been instrumental to our continued success.

  The mechanical engineering department of UBC has supported our team since its inception, providing us with work-space and technical and financial resources.

  UBC has also sponsored us through the Professional Activities Fund and the Walter Gage Fund. We too would like to thank Shell Canada Ltd for providing additional financial support through the Shell Engineering Student Fund.
