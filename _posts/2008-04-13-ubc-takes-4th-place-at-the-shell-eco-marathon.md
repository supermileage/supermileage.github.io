After 3 days of spirited competition, the UBC Supermileage team was able to place 4th in our inaugural year at the [Shell Eco-Marathon][1] in Fontana, California with a mileage of 1864.9 mpg.

A thank you to Shell for hosting a successful event, and to UBC and our sponsors for their continued support.
