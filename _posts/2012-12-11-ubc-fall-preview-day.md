Last week UBC Engineering department hosted the Fall Preview Day. This was a chance for high school students, first year engineering undergrads, and anyone interested in applied sciences to meet professors, explore lab spaces, and learn the ins and outsÂ of studying engineering. As part of the Preview Day the UBC Supermileage Team and all of the other engineering student design teams took over the Engineering Design Centre to show off their projects and vehicles. It was great seeing so many new faces and getting them excited about Supermileage; we look forward to seeing some of them again next year on the Team!
