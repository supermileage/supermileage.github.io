The UBC Supermileage team attended the American Society for Engineering Education conference this week in Seattle. Thank you to the Shell Eco-Marathon team for inviting us to attend this conference with Norman Koch, Shell Eco-Marathon Global Technical Director and Anne Buchanan, Shell Eco-Marathon Americas Teams Liaison. We had a chance to show off the Zoticus, explain our fuel efficiency innovations and encourage future participants of the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas.
