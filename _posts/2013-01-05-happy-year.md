Happy new year from all of us at UBC Supermileage! We&#8217;ve had our first meeting of 2013 and we&#8217;re stepping up our game as competition approaches. Our priority for the next couple of weeks will be building the aero shell. We&#8217;ve joined and assembled the mold pieces that Vorum carved for us  and have coated the entire thing in fibreglass so as to create a smooth female-mold surface for carbon fibre lay-up  (check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubcst" target="_blank">facebook page</a> for pictures). Our new engine will also be up and running within the next 2 weeks, and when it is the engine division will use our newly functioning dyno to tune the engine to optimal running conditions. We haven&#8217;t been able to perform engine tuning in previous competitions, and having this ability now should give us a significant increase in fuel efficiency.

We have a lot to do before the Shell Eco-marathon this April, but thanks to our expanded team we have the numbers necessary to get it all done. Good work everybody and keep it up!
