The UBC Supermileage Team returned from the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas this week with some impressive results. We achieved 5th place out of about 60 in our first year back in the gasoline prototype division with the 1383 mpg Mark VIII! The Odysseus doubled last year&#8217;s mileage and took 2nd with 577 mpg, putting us back on the podium for the first time since 2006! Great work team and thank you sponsors!
