SKF Bearings is one of five divisions of the SKF Group, the other four focusing on seals, mechatronics, services, and lubrication systems. In accordance with the Supermileage  focus of efficiency and thereby reduced emissions, SKF has pledged to reduce their CO2 emissions by 5% annually, regardless of their production volume and growth.
