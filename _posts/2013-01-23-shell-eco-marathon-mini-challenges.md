As part of the run up to the Eco-marathon, this year Shell is holding Mini Shell Eco-marathon Challenges. There are some excellent prizes to be won, including a send-off meal for the entire team and the cost of shipping our competition vehicle down to Houston covered. We&#8217;re looking to win some challenges, and you can help!

We&#8217;re entering two Mini Challenges:

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">1. Social media promotion contest</span>

<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> This challenge takes place over several social media sites, but we&#8217;re focusing on Facebook. The goal is to get the most &#8216;Likes&#8217; on a team page out of all the Canadian Supermileage Teams; currently our Like count stands at 144. Help us win the event by visiting our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubcst" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and giving it a Like!</span>

2. Shell Eco-marathon Learning Event

This challenge sees the UBC Supermileage Team hosting an event to engage the community and raise awareness of Supermileage, what we do, and what the Eco-marathon is all about. We win the challenge by hosting the largest number of people, so come on out and show your support! The time and a place of our event have yet to be decided, but details will be posted to the website and Facebook page when available.

With your support we can show that the best Canadian Supermileage Team comes from right here at UBC!
