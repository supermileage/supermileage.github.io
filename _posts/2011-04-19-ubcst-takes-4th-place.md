After several days of spirited competition, the UBC Supermileage Team&#8217;s Urban Concept Car (the Argo) took 4th place in the 2011 Shell Eco-Marathon Americas competition in Houston, Texas with a mileage of 214 mpg.

A thank you to Shell for hosting a successful event, and to UBC and our sponsors for their continued support.
