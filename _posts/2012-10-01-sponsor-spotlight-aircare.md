Vancouver is proud to be one of the greenest cities in the world. It boasts  over 200 public parks, 75 community gardens, and 90% of the city&#8217;s energy is derived from renewable sources. In 1992 the Ministry of Environment and Metro Vancouver Air Quality initiated the Motor Vehicle Emissions Inspection and Maintenance Program, or as it&#8217;s more commonly known, AirCare. Since its inception AirCare has tested and certified hundreds of thousands of vehicles, and as a result have lowered vehicle emissions in the lower mainland by 33%. AirCare has generously supported us in the past, and is continuing this tradition into 2013.
