The UBC Supermileage Team is competing in the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas 2015 in the new city of Detroit from April 8-13th. The team will compete in the Gasoline Urban Concept division with the Zoticus, and in the Gasoline Prototype division with the Mark X. We are proud to have re-designed and built both these vehicles in one year and are looking forward to a great competition. Follow us on our [blog](https://superblogii.wordpress.com/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ubcst) for updates and photos of the team in action at this exciting international competition.
