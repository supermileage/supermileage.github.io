Intergulf Development Group is part of the Intergulf Group of Companies. They are residential and commercial builders in BC, Alberta and California, who&#8217;s projects include Kits360 in Vancouver, Promenade in White Rock, and Grand Central I in Coquitlam just to name a few. Intergulf&#8217;s major focus is quality standards in all their projects, which they accomplish by taking all aspects of a project, from land acquisition, to building, to sales and warranty services, and completing them in house from start to finish. This focus has bred high levels of accountability and responsibility, both to their customers and also the environment. You can find out more about Intergulf by visiting <http://www.intergulf.com/>
