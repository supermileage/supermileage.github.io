We&#8217;ve had some great success in the Shell Ecomarathon Urban Concept Division, and this year we hope to continue that tradition with some major overhauls to our vehicle. We are officially retiring the Argo, and beginning work on our new Urban Concept Vehicle (name pending). Among our major redesigns is a new aero shell &#8211; manufacturing assistance of the mold provided by Vorum &#8211; and we&#8217;re planning to replace the aircraft-grade aluminium honeycomb chassis with a lightweight composite. We now have 3 years of experience in the Urban Concept Division, and drawing on this and the ability of our talented team the UBC Supermileage Team is aiming for a top three finish at the next Shell Eco-marathon.

Thanks for all the support, and stay tuned for more updates!
