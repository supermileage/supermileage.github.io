          The UBC Supermileage team is a group of 50 dedicated engineering students working to design and
          build fuel efficient gasoline powered vehicles for the Shell Eco-marathon Americas and the Society
          of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Supermileage Competitions. Our diverse team includes technical
          students from mechanical, eng-physics, integrated, computer, electrical, chemical, materials, manufacturing, geological, and environmental
          engineering as well as business, science, and more.

        <p class="text-muted">
          Fuelathon competitions provide engineering and technology students with a challenging design project
          that involves the development and construction of either a single-person, Prototype Concept or a
          larger four wheeled Urban Concept car. Students design and build 3 different cars, each with a different energy class: a <strong>conventional gas-powered</strong>, in the Prototype category, a <strong>hydrogen fuel cell-powered</strong> in the Prototype category and a <strong>battery electric-powered</strong>,
          in the Urban Concept category, ultra-efficient vehicles. As a team, we aim to set a world fuel economy
          record and increase public awareness for fuel economy, efficiency, and sustainability. Students
          become more sensitive to environmental issues as well as develop important project management
          skills.

                The Urban Concept Car is a more practical vehicle meant to bridge the gap between the
                prototype vehicle and the vehicles you see on the road today. With the advent of
                consumer level electric cars, we converted our Urban Concept to a battery electric
                vehicle in 2018. It only competes at the Shell Eco-Marathon. Teams are required to
                design the vehicle with a minimum of four wheels, larger stance, headlights, tail
                lights, turn signals and other practical considerations that the average city vehicle
                requires today.

                polymer on both sides. The wider width of the Urban Concept chassis allows for the
                chassis thickness to be reduced without compromising rigidity. The total weight of the
                chassis (including all components except the engine) is approximately 120 lbs.

                The Prototype vehicle is a three wheeled, single-passenger vehicle meant to push the
                limits of fuel efficiency. It competes in the Shell Eco-Marathon, and SAE Supermileage
                competitions. This competition class has very few limits on design, allowing a number of
                creative solutions in order to achieve extremely high fuel mileage. With optimization of
                aerodynamics, weight, and rolling resistance, we maximize the performance of our heavily
                modified engine.

                The engine used in our Prototype vehicle is a Briggs & Stratton Junior206. This engine
                is standard for all teams in the SAE Supermileage Competition. This stock engine is
                205cc’s with a maximum horsepower rating of 8 horsepower and a torque of 10 ft-lb. This
                year, a custom cylinder head has been designed to increase the compression ratio from
                8.5:1 to 12:1. This will achieve a decreased displacement from 205cc to 68cc, resulting
                in a greater thermal efficiency.

              <p>
                Our current Prototype vehicle uses a carbon fibre - Nomex sandwich where 1.5" of
                lightweight Nomex honeycomb is sandwiched between carbon fibre and Kevlar reinforced
                polymer on both sides. The use of thicker Nomex than the Urban Concept is to compensate
                for the narrower chassis, which is reduced in size to minimize weight. The total weight
                of the chassis (including all components except the engine) is less than 80 lbs.

              <p>
                The newly innovated powertrain is configured as a two-stage, fixed-pulley reduction
                system. As the name implies, there are two pulley reductions from the engine to the
                wheel. The flexible drive of the powertrain has been switched from roller chains to
                carbon fiber timing belts to optimize weight, while maintaining a high strength. In
                addition, timing belts can deliver comparable efficiency to a roller chain system,
                however, there is less maintenance associated with timing belts. By designing our
                vehicle to run at a maximum speed of 50 km/hr, this system allows our engine to transmit
                power at its optimal speed.

              <p class="item-intro text-muted">Handlebars</p>
              <p>
                The Prototype vehicle steering system is similar to that of a motorcycle, where there
                are two handlebars for steering, a throttle, and braking handlebars. The space inside
                for the driver is very limited and the driver drives lying down, so this design allows
                us to use the confined space efficiently. Steering for this vehicle is operated through
                the front wheels.

                The Hydrogen Prototype vehicle is the newest addition to the team, as it was built and ran for the first time in the summer of 2021. 
                Similar to the Gasoline Prototype vehicle, it is a three wheeled, single-passenger vehicle meant to push the limits of fuel efficiency. It competes in the Shell Eco-Marathon competition. This competition class has very few limits on design, allowing a number of
                creative solutions in order to achieve extremely high fuel mileage. With optimization of

              <p>
                Partnering with a local fuel cell company Unilia and local machine shops, our team was able to develop a custom made Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell for our vehicle. This allows us to have greater control over the performance parameters of the fuel cell, and gives us the opportunity not only to learn about the inner workings of a fuel cell but also tailor the performance for efficiency. From custom machined flow field channels, to running at a low current density, to testing and optimizing fuel pressures, everything was designed to optimize the fuel efficiency of our new fuel cell prototype vehicle. Compared to fuel cells found in conventional vehicles, our fuel cell also has a much smaller footprint and runs with a lower current density in order to operate in a higher efficiency band rather than prioritizing power output

              <p>
                This powertrain system uses a two-stage, chain drive
                system. As the name implies, there are two chains reductions from the motor to the
                wheel. High quality roller chains are used to maximize efficiency in the energy transfer. 
                By designing our vehicle to run at an average speed of 25 km/hr, this system allows our motor 
                to operate at its optimum power output. The selection of the motor and the gear ratio are 
                optimized for each track that we compete on and is designed to be easily interchangeable

              <p>
                The Hydrogen Prototype vehicle steering system is similiar to that of a bicycle. It uses
                two handlebars for steering, a thumb throttle to accelerate, and a rear wheel braking handlebar.
                Since the space inside for the driver is very limited and the driver drives lying down, this ligthweight,
                intuitive and easy to use design allows us to use the confined space efficiently while making it easier for 
                the driver to control the vehicle. Steering for this vehicle is operated through
                the front wheels.
