## Writing a New Post
Please see [this wiki page](https://github.com/supermileage/supermileage-website-archive/wiki/Writing-a-New-Post) for instructions. If you are only going to be writing posts, you can ignore the rest of this readme.


Another option is to use Netlify CMS to write posts. Visit [this page](https://supermileage.github.io/admin) to write a new post. 

## Installation

Clone the repo onto your own computer. Make sure you have Ruby installed; bundler should handle the rest. 

Once you have Ruby installed, run these commands:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
```

## Running the Project
In the same directory, run:


`bundle exec jekyll serve`

You can now browse to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view the site. There's no need to restart jekyll after you make changes, it will update automatically.
